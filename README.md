# Portfolio
Portfolio assignment/project: used mainly HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for dark mode. 

-🥐 Because it is also an assignment for school (Moroccan school), the portfolio is in French.

Tried to make it as responsive as possible
🌙 Light/Dark mode toggle with localStorage memory
⚡ Fast and lightweight — no frameworks for a 1st year student, it has been a good learning experience, and I hope to come back with more experience and enhance it, maybe even use a framework.

btw the picture is a bit old (too lazy to take a new one) 🙂
